title: "MEDS Capstone Projects"
---

The MEDS program ends with a group Capstone project where students work in teams of 3-4 to design, develop and share a deliverable that helps a client to gain insights, answer questions, and/or create communication materials using environmental data. The goal of the MEDS Capstone is to help students build real-world data science and professional skills while working with a client to complete a project using environmental data. 

The [Request for Proposals](https://bren.ucsb.edu/research/masters-research/request-proposals-meds) oens in the Spring for the following year.
