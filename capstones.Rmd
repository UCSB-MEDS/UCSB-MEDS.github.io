## Overview

All MEDS students will work in groups of 3-4 students to design, develop and share a deliverable that helps a client to gain insights, answer questions, and/or create communication materials using environmental data. 

## Goal

The goal of the MEDS Capstone is to help students build real-world data science and professional skills while working with a client to complete a project using environmental data.
