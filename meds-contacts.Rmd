She was once named one of the three “kooky data science aunts” (along with Jamie Montgomery and Allison Horst) by an anonymous MEDS student and she wears that title proudly. You will be seeing lots of her around NCEAS helping out where needed throughout the program. If you ever have any questions about data science, ecology, grad school, life in SB, etc. or have an idea for a workshop, stop by her office or send her an email at any time!*</span>

<span style = 'font-size:95%;'>*Are you wondering what kind of computing resources that you have available to you at Bren or how you can utilize them? Are you having trouble installing the software that you need for class or connecting to our Bren servers? Is technology just not cooperating with you and you need a helping hand? Did you just bork your computer? Well, if you answered yes to any of the questions above, then you should try talking to Kat. Kat is here to help you with all your tech support needs. After many years of yelling at her computer to work, she has learned many tips and tricks that are more helpful than throwing your laptop out of the window. If she can’t fix it herself, she knows who to talk to in order to figure it out. She may not have all the answers, but you bet she’s happy to struggle through solving your tech problems with you.*</span>

`r fontawesome::fa("envelope", fill = "#047C90", a11y = "sem")` kyom@bren.ucsb.edu  
<span style = 'font-size:95%;'>*If you’ve ever wondered who, exactly, sat on the receiving end of your MEDS application - it was Kimberly. Kimberly works on the Admissions and Student Affairs team, which means that she processes applications and gets to know students well before they ever step foot in NCEAS or Bren Hall. Aside from getting to know them just on paper, Kimberly serves as a resource for MEDS students to help them with any issues they might encounter in graduate school, whether it’s questions about degree requirements, financial awards, or resources to help with personal matters. If you have any questions or just want to chat, swing by her office or drop her a line!*</span>
