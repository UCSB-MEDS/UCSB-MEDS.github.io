    "contents": "\nHi there! This post is coming to you from Juliet Cohen and Scout Leonard! We are both students at UCSB’s Bren School of Environmental Science & Management in the inaugural cohort of the Masters of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) Program.\nAbout us\nScout is interested in growing as an environmental data scientist after having worked with large datasets through food system and food security work in Oakland, California. Already, she is so pleased with the emphasis her MEDS courses have placed on responsible data science, as she hopes to use her MEDS toolkit to influence food security and resource use policy that builds sustainable, equitable food systems. You can learn more about her previous and ongoing work at her website: scoutcleonard.github.io.\nJuliet is interested in applying environmental data science to wildlife biology and the interaction between humans and endangered species’ natural habitats. Juliet was inspired by her experience serving as a field technician in California and Hawaii. Throughout the MEDS summer curriculum, Juliet strengthened her collaborative programming skills and looks forward to learning about spatial analysis and modeling large, dynamic data sets. She hopes to contribute to open-source projects in the future.\nMEDS Summer Session\nFor the first 6 weeks of our degree, we embarked on a whirlwind introduction to data science. From 9 AM to 5 PM we sat in the newly constructed MEDS classroom at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) in downtown Santa Barbara, learning the basics to jumpstart our data science degrees. These week-long classes consisted not only of lectures, but oalso coding labs, collaborative team science projects, individual and group presentations. We also had “flex sessions” for non-course content, like panels from various data scientists at NCEAS and representatives from local groups of R users, such as Santa Barbara R Ladies and EcoDataScience. Our summer term laid the foundation not only for the code we’ll write this year, but also for how we create workflows and collaborate as budding environmental data scientists. These courses included:\nEDS 212: Essential Math in Environmental Data Science\nEDS 221: Scientific Programming Essentials\nEDS 214: Analytical Workflows and Scientific Reproducibility\nEDS 215: Introduction to Data Storage and Management\nEDS 216: Meta-Analysis and Systematic Reviews\nAfter this intense MEDS summer we took some time to relax before fall quarter, but we also took this blog-post-writing opportunity to showcase some of what our class has learned so far.\nAs we reflected on the first quarter of our degree, we decided it may be more interesting to show, rather than tell, some of the skills we’ve learned. We also thought it might be fun to share reflections from our whole cohort to truly represent the student experience of this fast-paced, learning-filled summer.\nWhat did MEDS students think about summer courses?\nSurvey Development\nWe developed a Google Form survey for our classmates to gather data about their perspectives on these first six weeks. We had two main questions:\nwhat did the cohort think of our classes?\nwhat kinds of fun things has the group been up to in our delightful home of Santa Barbara?\nOur questions were developed with data tidying and visualization in mind and when we got some unexpected answers, we developed perspective about how our survey could have been better to help us with a bit less wrangling. MEDS students, however, do not shy away from problematic data, so we persisted with the problems that arose :)\nAnalysis\nThe following is a step-by-step description of how we wrangled and visualized the most interesting survey responses including neat graphics describing our MEDS summer, from tidying data to surfing after class. We hope you find it insightful, but also fun :)\nOur Data\n\n\n#load libraries\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(wordcloud)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(ggwordcloud)\nlibrary(paletteer)\n\n\n\nFirst, we read the data from our Google form survey, which we were able to download as a .csv file, into the R project we made for this blog project.\n\n\ndata <- read_csv(\"data/MEDS Summer Reflection Survey (Responses) - Responses Clean.csv\")\n\n\n\nData Tidying\nNext, we renamed the columns. Google forms does this frustrating, but understandable thing where the names of the columns of data are the questions we asked participants. This makes for super long names that are not fun to write code with. We instead named the columns of interest with the corresponding order of our coursework, i.e. column 1 is our first course, EDS 212.\n\n\n#colnames(data) renames the columns\n\ndata_clean <- data %>% \n  rename(\"1\" =  \"Write 3 words to describe or represent week 1 (EDS212 w/ Allison) here:\") %>% \n  rename(\"2_3\" =  \"Write 3 words to describe or represent weeks 2 & 3 (EDS221 w/ Allison) here:\") %>% \n  rename(\"4\" =  \"Write 3 words to describe or represent week 4 (EDS214 w/ Julien) here:\") %>% \n  rename(\"5\" =  \"Write 3 words to describe or represent week 5 (EDS215 w/ Frew) here:\") %>% \n  rename(\"6\" =  \"Write 3 words to describe or represent week 1 (EDS216 w/ Scott) here:\")\n\n\n\nData Wrangling\nThe Google form format included five questions (one for each summer course) where students wrote in three words to describe how they felt about the course. In the .csv of the survey data, the three words submitted by a participant were grouped together in one cell per course.\nTo visualize how often certain descriptors for each summer course appear, we first needed to separate the three terms submitted for each course into separate observations. We executed this using the separate_rows() function. This expanded the terms into three separate observations per student in each class column.\n\n\n# separate the columns into rows by parsing the 3 words in each observation into 3 different observations\n# select certain cols because our first data viz is only using certain cols \ndata_clean_1 <- data_clean %>% \n  separate_rows(\"1\") %>% \n  select(\"Email Address\",\"1\")\n\ndata_clean_2_3 <- data_clean %>% \n  separate_rows(\"2_3\")%>% \n  select(\"Email Address\",\"2_3\")\n\ndata_clean_4 <- data_clean %>% \n  separate_rows(\"4\") %>% \n  select(\"Email Address\",\"4\")\n\ndata_clean_5 <- data_clean %>% \n  separate_rows(\"5\") %>% \n  select(\"Email Address\",\"5\")\n\ndata_clean_6 <- data_clean %>% \n  separate_rows(\"6\") %>% \n  select(\"Email Address\",\"6\")\n\n\n\nThen, to observe the frequency of words used to describe each course, we used the table function. This creates a table that has two columns: one for each distint descriptive word students used and the frequency with which the words occur for the class. Then, we converted that table to a data frame.\n\n\n# use the table() function to take counts of each \"factor\" (words) and use the data.frame() function to convert these tables to data frames\n\ncourse_1 <- data.frame(table(data_clean_1$\"1\"))\n\ncourse_1_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(course_1)\n\ncourse_2_3 <- data.frame(table(data_clean_2_3$\"2_3\"))\n\ncourse_2_3_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(course_2_3)\n\ncourse_4 <- data.frame(table(data_clean_4$\"4\"))\n\ncourse_4_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(course_4)\n\ncourse_5 <- data.frame(table(data_clean_5$\"5\"))\n\ncourse_5_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(course_5) %>% \n  filter(!Var1 == \"tangent\") %>% \n  filter(!Var1 == \"tangents\") %>% \n  filter(!Var1 == \"dry\")\n\ncourse_6 <- data.frame(table(data_clean_6$\"6\"))\n\ncourse_6_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(course_6)\n\n\n\nData Visualizing\nAfter this, we wanted to visualize the frequency of words for each class. We used ggplot to create word clouds which represented the frequency of class descriptors. The word clouds display the descriptive words submitted by our classmates in sizes proportional to the frequency the words were used. The ggplot plot we used is called ggwordcloud. We updated the colors by adding an aesthetic feature where each class descriptor is represented by a different color. We also updated the word size so that the cloud was easier to read.\nSince we used ggplot quite a bit in EDS 221, we opted for this method for generating word clouds over another package called wordcloud, which is specifically for word clouds. We found that we wanted to showcase our visualization skills by stacking visualizations and adding titles and colors, and it was easier to do this in a ggplot version of word clouds, since we had so much practice with other plots in ggplot.\nThe code chunk below is where we tried the wordcloud package. It made the correct visualizations, but we found it more difficult to make them as nice as some of the ggplots we made in class. It was a relief to learn that there is a word cloud feature in ggplot!\nAnd finally, the ggplot word clouds!\n\n\n# for each cloud, specify the background color within the theme to match the background color of the blog This same code was repeated for all word clouds.\n\ncloud_1 <- ggplot(course_1_df, aes(label = Var1, size = Freq, color = Var1)) +\n  geom_text_wordcloud() +\n  scale_size_area(max_size = 25) +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 25),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Week 1 EDS 212: Essential Math in Environmental Data Science\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# use patchwork to stack the graphs\n\ncloud_1 / cloud_2_3 / cloud_4 / cloud_5 / cloud_6\n\n\n\n\nWhat do MEDS students do outside of class?\nOur full-day classes kept us busy during the week, but since they were designed without additional assignments outside of class we were able to take advantage of our evenings and weekends. The most popular activities were surfing, going to the beach, and biking.\n\n\n# download cvs for SB activities\ndata_activities <- read_csv(\"data/sb_activities_data.csv\")\n\n# make data.frame for SB activities histogram\n\nactivities_clean <- data.frame(table(data_activities$\"sb_activities\"))\n\nSB_activities <- ggplot(activities_clean, aes(y = reorder(Var1, +Freq), x = Freq)) +\n  geom_histogram(stat = 'identity', aes(fill = Var1, color = \"blue\")) +\n  scale_fill_paletteer_d(\"dutchmasters::milkmaid\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        panel.grid = element_blank(),\n        panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\")) +\n  labs(title = \"MEDS Favorite Santa Barbara Activities\",\n       y = \"Activity\",\n       x = \"Total Votes\")\n\nSB_activities\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the MEDS students excited for in Fall quarter?\n\n“Expanding my coding fundamentals, tidy Tuesday’s, building a portfolio and updating my website, and working collaboratively on the capstone project.”\n\n\n“I’m excited to build on the foundation we created this summer!”\n\n\n“Excited to work with some spatial data in Frew’s next class!”\n\n\n“I’m looking forward to learning more skills in data science and be able to apply them to assignments and projects in our classes. I’m also looking forward to learning more about potential future careers in environmental data science.”\n\nMeet the MEDS cohort!\nClass photo on our first day of Orientation at Bren Hall\nThe MEDS 2022 cohort gathered at NCEAS after class during summer session.\nMembers of the MEDS cohort in downtown Santa Barbara celebrating completing the first half of summer session classes with faculty and their pets.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\nIn the last blog post, we mentioned that we had been busy building all kinds of things, e.g. courses, websites, even actual buildings! It’s finally time to use these newly-built objects. Only 13 days left until MEDS Orientation begins and we couldn’t be more excited to meet all of you!\nOrientation\nThe MEDS orientation will be a hybrid (in-person and remote) two-day event with Day 1 at Bren Hall and Day 2 at NCEAS (see instructions). During orientation, students will get up to speed on the necessary hardware and software, learn more about the program’s requirements and courses, and - of course - get to know one another! Students can view the schedule here using their NetID and password. Be sure to check your inboxes as we’ll be sending additional information you need to know!\nGetting to NCEAS\nAs you may already know, NCEAS recently moved from State Street to 1021 Anacapa St. In addition to hosting leading-edge research, this brand new building has a classroom and work stations for the MEDS students. Entering the building is a little tricky as the entrance to the MEDS space is off of the parking lot, not Anacapa - see photo below.\n\n\n\nParking\nThere is a city lot attached to the building. It is free for the first 75 minutes and $1.50 per hour after that. There is free street parking a few blocks away, just make sure to look for street sweeping restrictions.\nThere is limited bike parking available nearby on the sidewalk.\nBus\nIf you live in on-campus housing, or in Isla Vista, the Santa Barbara MTD 24X line is the most efficient bus route between NCEAS and the University. Hop on at the closest stop to your home, and get off at the transit center on Carillo and Chapala, which is just 2 blocks from NCEAS. Be sure to check the schedule so you arrive before Orientation and classes begin\nIf you have any questions, we can be reached at academics@bren.ucsb.edu.\n\n\n\n",

Covid-19 has changed how we work together (so much Zoom), but hasn’t lessened how much love and energy we’re putting into the program. Here’s a little bit about what we’ve been up to.\nBuilding this website\nWelcome to our MEDS website! We are building this website primarily as a place for our MEDS students to use as a resource for what’s happening in the program. It will contain links to course websites, information about daily schedules, career workshop schedules, capstone project timelines, and more!\nWe have big dreams for what this site will include - student blog posts! Interactive data visualizations! Capstone project highlights! Stay tuned as we build out the site with all things MEDS.\nExpanding the MEDS team\nSince October we’ve been doing a LOT of building - building courses, building cohesion across courses, building websites, and even building new classrooms. So yeah…a lot happening around here. Thankfully, we’ve also been building our MEDS team, and have recently welcomed exciting new team members dedicated specifically to the MEDS program.\nJamie Montgomery - MEDS Program Coordinator\n\n In January we were thrilled to welcome our amazing MEDS Program Coordinator Jamie Montgomery, alum of the Bren School Master of Environmental Science and Management program (Class of 2013), who for the past 8 years has been working as a Marine Data Scientist with the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). Whether leading the Ocean Health Index’s US Northeast analysis, organizing (and teaching in) our world-famous Eco-Data-Science learning group, working to support diverse R-users through R-Ladies Santa Barbara, or doing special projects like analyzing tweets to evaluate where locals versus tourists tend to visit in SB, Jamie is a leader in Santa Barbara and R data science communities. We are so lucky to have her leading our trailblazing MEDS program!\n\nKimberly Yom - MEDS Admissions & Student Affairs Coordinator\n\n We also recently welcomed Kimberly Yom, our MEDS Admissions and Student Affairs Coordinator. Well, technically we welcomed her back to the Bren School - Kimberly previously worked at Bren as the MESM Academic Programs Assistant where she learned about Bren’s collaborative, mission-driven focus! After working in contract administration for the UCSB Design & Construction department, she is back at Bren as the MEDS Admissions and Student Affairs Coordinator. We are really grateful to have a person with so much knowledge about the inner workings of both the Bren School and UCSB in this role in MEDS!\nAs the Admissions and Student Affairs Coordinator, Kimberly recruits admitted students, helps organize the admissions process, evaluates applications, and hosts meetings with prospective and admitted students to answer questions about the MEDS program and provide campus resources. Kimberly is “thrilled about the advent of the MEDS program as it supplies students with the data science skills needed to develop informed solutions to the world’s complex environmental issues.” For any questions regarding admissions or MEDS program logistics, she can be reached at kyom@bren.ucsb.edu.\n\nMiya Scheble - MEDS Career Development Program Manager\n\nMiya Scheble joined the renowned Bren Career Team in November as the MEDS Career Development Program Manager. Prior to joining the Career Development team, Miya worked as a project coordinator and marketing assistant at a marketing, branding, and design company. She brings project management, customer relations, and marketing experience to Bren.\nAs the MEDS Career Development Program Manager, Miya oversees the day-to-day operations of the MEDS Career Development Program and helps students develop lifelong career skills that will help them secure desirable jobs and advance successfully throughout their entire career. With a background in environmental science and a strong interest in data science herself, Miya agrees with the NCEAS statement that “the next generation of environmental scientists are data scientists.” Miya is “very excited to welcome the first cohort of MEDS students and support them throughout their career journeys.” For more information about career development and advising services at Bren, she can be reached at: miya@bren.ucsb.edu.\n\nNCEAS on the move\nThe National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS), which will be hosting the program part time, is moving! NCEAS has been located on State Street in downtown Santa Barbara for over 25 years. This year NCEAS is moving just a couple blocks away to 1021 Anacapa Street. Before we move, and while we are all still working from home, the building is undergoing some renovations. The first floor of the building will host the MEDS program and will have a brand new classroom that holds 90 students. In addition there will be a student lounge, private meeting room, kitchen, and dedicated work stations. We are so excited about this brand new space for our students, keep an eye out for pictures of the new space in July!\n\n\n\n",
