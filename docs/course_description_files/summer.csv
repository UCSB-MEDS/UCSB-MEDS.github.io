EDS 212,Essential Math for Environmental Data Science,2,"Review of quantitative methods that are commonly used in environmental science. The course will cover single and multivariable functions and graphing, basic linear algebra, complex numbers, integral calculus and simple differential equations.",Allison Horst
EDS 221,Scientific Programming Essentials,4,"This course teaches key scientific programming skills and demonstrates the application of these techniques to environmental data analysis and problem solving. Topics include structured programming and algorithm development, flow control, simple and advanced data input-output and representation, functions and objects, documentation, testing and debugging. The course will be taught using a combination of the R and Python programming languages.",Allison Horst
EDS 214,Analytical Workflows and Scientific Reproducibility,2,"The generation and analysis of environmental data is often a complex, multi-step process that may involve the collaboration of many people. Increasingly tools that document and help to organize workflows are being used to ensure reproducibility, shareability, and transparency of the results. This course will introduce students to the conceptual organization of workflows (including code, documents, and data) as a way to conduct reproducible analyses. These concepts will be combined with the practice of various software tools and collaborative coding techniques to develop and manage multi-step analytical workflows as a team.",Julien Brun
EDS 217,Python for Environmental Data Science,4,"This course teaches the fundamentals of programming in Python. Students will learn foundational skills and concepts including data structures, programming basics, and how to clean, subset, aggregate, transform and visualize data. Course materials demonstrate the application of these techniques for environmental data analysis and problem solving.",Kelly Caylor
