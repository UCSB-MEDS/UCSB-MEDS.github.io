EDS 232,Machine Learning in Environmental Science,4,"Machine learning can help process big/complex data and extract knowledge. It forms one of the foundations in data science. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include supervised learning (decision tree, random forest, support vector machines, neural networks) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, deep learning). Problems and exercises are framed within environmental science applications. The course will use programming languages like R and Python to support learning how to do advanced scientific programming to solve real environmental problems.",Mateo Robbins
EDS 240,Data Visualization and Communication,4,"This course will focus on basic principles for effective communication through data visualization. Students will deepen their understanding of how people perceive and interpret graphical representations, and will learn about information visualization frameworks they can apply to design intuitive and impactful data visualizations. Beyond effective visualization design, we will explore ‘storytelling with data’ --integration of visual elements and text in a way that is clear, concise and engaging. Class time will consist of brief periods of lecture interspersed with small group and whole group discussions, peer critiques, and hands-on data visualization activities. Assignments will involve applying such frameworks and concepts in critique of existing visualizations, and in creation of data visualizations using popular software packages.",Stacy Rebich-Hespanha
EDS 241,Environmental Policy Evaluation,2,"This course will present state of the art program evaluation techniques necessary to evaluate the impact of environmental policies. The program evaluation methods presented will aim at identifying and measuring the causal effect of policies, regulations, and interventions on environmental outcomes of interest. Students will learn the research designs and methods for estimating causal effects with experimental and non-experimental data. This will prepare the students for interpreting and conducting high-quality empirical research, with applications in cross-sectional data and panel data settings.",Olivier Deschenes
EDS 411A,MEDS Capstone Course,4,"First quarter of a two-quarter group study/analysis of how to apply data science and tools to an environmental problem. In this quarter, students are expected to work with their project client to finalize project plans, assign individual roles and responsibilities, develop a project design plan and deliverables, and make significant headway on implementing those plans.",Naomi Tague
