EDS 232,Machine Learning in Environmental Science,4,"Machine learning can help process big/complex data and extract knowledge. It forms one of the foundations in data science. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include supervised learning (decision tree, random forest, support vector machines, neural networks) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, deep learning). Problems and exercises are framed within environmental science applications. The course will use programming languages like R and Python to support learning how to do advanced scientific programming to solve real environmental problems.",Mateo Robbins
EDS 240,Data Visualization and Communication,4,"Effectively communicating your work in a responsible, accessible and visually-pleasing way is often (if not, always) a central part of data science. This course will focus on the basic principles for effective communication through data visualization and using technical tools and workflows for creating and sharing data visualizations with diverse audiences. 

By the end of this course, learners should be able to: 

- Identify which types of visualizations are most appropriate for your data and your audience
- Prepare (e.g. clean, explore, wrangle) data so that it’s appropriately formatted for building data visualizations
- Build effective, responsible, accessible, and aesthetically-pleasing, visualizations using the R programming language, and specifically {ggplot2} + ggplot2 extension packages
- Write code from scratch and read and adapt code written by others
- Apply a DEI (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) lens to the process of designing data visualizations 
- Assess, critique, and provide constructive feedback on data visualizations",Samantha Csik
EDS 241,Environmental Policy Evaluation,2,"This course will present state of the art program evaluation techniques necessary to evaluate the impact of environmental policies. The program evaluation methods presented will aim at identifying and measuring the causal effect of policies, regulations, and interventions on environmental outcomes of interest. Students will learn the research designs and methods for estimating causal effects with experimental and non-experimental data. This will prepare the students for interpreting and conducting high-quality empirical research, with applications in cross-sectional data and panel data settings.",Thomas Heckelei
EDS 411A,MEDS Capstone Course,4,"First quarter of a two-quarter group study/analysis of how to apply data science and tools to an environmental problem. In this quarter, students are expected to work with their project client to finalize project plans, assign individual roles and responsibilities, develop a project design plan and deliverables, and make significant headway on implementing those plans.",Carmen Galaz García
