With less than four months until orientation for our first ever cohort of [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) students, we're full speed ahead with MEDS! Covid-19 has changed how we work together (so much Zoom), but hasn't lessened how much love and energy we're putting into the program. Here's a little bit about what we've been up to.

## Expanding the MEDS team

Since October we've been doing a LOT of building - building courses, building cohesion *across* courses, building websites, and even building new classrooms. So yeah...a lot happening around here. Thankfully, we've also been building our MEDS team, and have recently welcomed exciting new team members dedicated specifically to the MEDS program. 

### Jamie Montgomery - MEDS Program Coordinator

In January we were thrilled to welcome our amazing MEDS Program Coordinator [Jamie Montgomery](https://www.jamiecmontgomery.com/), alum of the [Bren School Master of Environmental Science and Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-science-and-management) program (Class of 2013), who for the past 8 years has been working as a Marine Data Scientist with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). Whether leading the Ocean Health Index's US Northeast analysis, organizing (and teaching in) our world-famous [Eco-Data-Science](https://eco-data-science.github.io/) learning group, working to support diverse R-users through [R-Ladies Santa Barbara](https://twitter.com/RLadiesSB), or doing special projects like analyzing tweets to evaluate where locals versus tourists tend to visit in SB, Jamie is a leader in Santa Barbara and R data science communities. We are so lucky to have her leading our trailblazing MEDS program!

## NCEAS on the move

One really exciting things about the MEDS program is that it's a Bren School degree program, but led in partnership with NCEAS. That means that MEDS courses and activities will be hosted at Bren (on the beautiful UCSB campus) *and* at NCEAS (in downtown Santa Barbara). Just a 15 minute drive (~ 11 mile flat-ish bike ride) apart, the two locations for the dual-campus program are not only stunning, but are also home to **communities of expert environmental data scientists, teachers, and researchers**.
