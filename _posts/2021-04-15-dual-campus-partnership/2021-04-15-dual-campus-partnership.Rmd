One really exciting things about the MEDS program is that it's a Bren School degree program, but led in partnership with NCEAS. That means that MEDS courses and activities will be hosted at Bren (on the beautiful UCSB campus) *and* at NCEAS (in downtown Santa Barbara). Just a 15 minute drive (~ 11 mile flat-ish bike ride) apart, the two locations for the dual-campus program are not only stunning, but are also home to **communities of expert environmental data scientists, teachers, and researchers**.
