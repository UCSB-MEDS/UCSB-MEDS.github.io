### Find your communities and get involved

There are lots of fun ways to get involved at Bren and meet other Bren students ([MESM](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/masters-students), [PhD](https://bren.ucsb.edu/people/phd-students)), from joining clubs and committees to sports, health and wellness with peers. Explore all the different opportunities on the [Bren website](https://bren.ucsb.edu/bren-student-activities) and contact academics@bren.ucsb.edu with any questions.

MEDS students serve as class representatives on five different committees (read more about them on the [Bren Website](https://bren.ucsb.edu/bren-student-activities)). Self-nominations and elections take place in Summer Quarter. To find your current MEDS committee representatives, please visit the [Bren School Committee Directory](https://bren.ucsb.edu/bren-school-committees).

### Discover your career in Environmental Data Science

We want to see all of our students find (and land) jobs and opportunities in environmental data science that they are excited about. Learn about some of the ways we're making that happen on our [Career Services & Support page](career.html).
