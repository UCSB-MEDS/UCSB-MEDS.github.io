**Computing requirements:** See the [MEDS Computing Requirements](computer_reqs.html) for minimum device needs. If you do not have a device that meets the minimum requirements, we may be unable to help troubleshoot some installation issues. Please submit issues [here](https://bren.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). 

## Necessary software:

- R
- RStudio
- git (configured)
- GitHub account (with PAT setup)
- Anaconda
- Slack
- Google Apps (Drive, Gmail, Calendar, Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.)

**Note:** All of these are free at the level you’ll need them at for MEDS. If you are asked to pay for something, you’re choosing the wrong option.
