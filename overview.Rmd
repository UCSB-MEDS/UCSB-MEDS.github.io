# Orientation

Each student should plan to attend **two** orientations: (1) a 2-day MEDS-only orientation on Thursday 8/01/2024 (at Bren) and Friday 8/02/2023 (at NCEAS) before summer classes begin on Monday 8/05/2023, and (2) a 3-day campus-wide UCSB orientation from Monday 9/23/2023 - Wednesday 9/25/2023.

*[Click here for the full Summer Orientation Schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17Xa6pqvEY3I4kZttbdqMCLiDJvNmVyEG/edit)*. For more information on the incoming MEDS student orientation, please visit the [Bren Website](https://bren.ucsb.edu/incoming-meds-student-orientation).

# Summer

## Summer Intensive Courses

During the first 6 weeks of the MEDS program (August through mid-September), students will take 4 intensive courses:

-   **Week 1:** EDS 212: Essential Math in Environmental Data Science (2 units)
-   **Weeks 2 & 3:** EDS 221: Scientific Programming Essentials (4 units)
-   **Week 4:** EDS 214: Analytical Workflows & Scientific Reproducibility (2 units)
-   **Week 5 & 6:** EDS 217: Python for Environmental Data Science (4 units)

For more detailed descriptions of the summer courses, see our [Courses](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/courses.html) page.

## Location

All Summer courses will be held at [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/) in downtown Santa Barbara. The address is 1021 Anacapa Street ([click here for directions](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/nceas.html#getting-to-nceas)).

NCEAS is \~11 miles (a 15 minute drive, without traffic) from the UC Santa Barbara campus, or a \~35 minute bus ride on the [24x line](https://sbmtd.gov/routes/route-24x/). The transit center downtown is \~3 blocks from NCEAS (a \<10 minute walk).

## A day in a Summer course

The Summer intensive session is designed to prepare MEDS students with the fundamental coding and computational skills necessary for all subsequent courses. These are full days of learning, running from 10:00am - 4:00pm Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and from 9:00am - 4:00pm on Wednesdays. Students generally **should not expect** additional assignments or MEDS-related work outside of these hours. In other words, courses will be structured so that all course requirements can be completed within the 9:00/10:00am - 4:00pm window while at NCEAS.

That doesn't mean you'll be watching lectures all day! Summer session days will be active, varied, and flexible, and students can expect a combination of course content (e.g. lectures, computational labs, individual and group tasks) and allotted time (on Wednesday mornings) for community-building, professional & career development activities, and more.

<!-- For example, a day during a Summer course might look like this: -->

<!-- |                   |                                                         | -->
<!-- |-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------| -->
<!-- | **Time (PST)**    | **Activity**                                            | -->
<!-- | 9:00am - 10:00am  | *Lecture 1 (60 min)*                                    | -->
<!-- | 10:00am - 11:00am | *Interactive Session 1 (60 min)*                        | -->
<!-- | 11:00am - 11:10am | *Break (10 min)*                                        | -->
<!-- | 11:10am - 12:00pm | *Flex time (50 min)*                                    | -->
<!-- | 12:00pm - 1:15pm  | *Lunch (75 min)*                                        | -->
<!-- | 1:15pm - 2:15pm   | *Lecture 2 (60 min)*                                    | -->
<!-- | 2:15pm - 3:15pm   | *Interactive Session 2 (45 min)*                        | -->
<!-- | 3:15pm - 5:00pm   | *Group & individual tasks (90 min)*                     | -->

<!-- With built-in breaks for coffee and lunch, interactive sessions for hands-on learning, and flex time for activities that change daily, we on the MEDS Team are working to make these days dynamic and fun while you build fundamental skills in environmental data science. -->

## Class activities

Summer is a special time for our MEDS students to bond both in and outside of class. While the coursework will be rigorous, we will also have dedicated breaks and events for relaxing, mingling and socializing. Thursday Happy Hour on the third floor terrace is a great opportunity to not only get to know your classmates, but also other MEDS and NCEAS staff, researchers, and faculty. We also look forward to celebrating important MEDS milestones, like both the halfway-point and completion of summer session.

# Fall/Winter/Spring

In Fall, Winter, and Spring quarters, core MEDS courses will be held at the Bren School (UCSB campus), with elective courses and some events held at NCEAS. Students can expect a more traditional academic class schedule (e.g. 2-3 classes/discussion sections/seminars a day). **You can add the MEDS [google calendar here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=c_1886ai526iqschc9mnpj6cu753n60@resource.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)**.

## Fall

In Fall Quarter, MEDS students will complete 14 units of coursework.

-   **EDS 220:** Working with Environmental Data (4 units)
-   **EDS 222:** Statistics for Environmental Data Science (4 units)
-   **EDS 223:** Geospatial Analysis & Remote Sensing (4 units)
-   **EDS 242:** Ethics & Bias in Environmental Data Science (2 units)

## Winter

In Winter Quarter, students will complete 14 units of coursework, three traditional academic courses and one 4-unit capstone project course.

-   **EDS 232:** Machine Learning in Environmental Science (4 units)
-   **EDS 240:** Data Visualization and Communication (4 units)
-   **EDS 241:** Environmental Policy Evaluation (2 units)
-   **EDS 411A:** Capstone Group Project A (4 units)

## Spring

In Spring Quarter, students will complete 14 units of coursework, three traditional academic courses and one 4-unit capstone project course.

-   **EDS 213:** Databases and Data Management (4 units)
-   **EDS 230:** Modeling Environmental Systems (4 units)
-   **EDS 231:** Text and Sentiment Analysis for Environmental Problems (2 units)
-   **EDS 411B:** Capstone Group Project B (4 units)

# Workshops

In addition to the MEDS core curriculum (as detailed above), additional workshops will be held  throughout the year. These include the following:

- [workshops and events led by the Career Services team](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/career.html) to guide students through the job search and application process (e.g. resume, cover letter, interviewing, and salary negotiation workshops, career talks and panels, etc.) -- these will typically take place on Thursday mornings from 8:15-9:15am at Bren or on Zoom
- [data science and technical workshops led by the MEDS Data Training Coordinator and campus-based teaching teams](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/workshops.html) -- these primarily live-coding-based workshops focus on technical skills that we believe are important for data scientists to have, but that don't fit neatly into existing core curricula (e.g. building & customizing personal websites, building R shiny apps and dashboards, etc.); please fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/q3jkV6BSCv5ddTyX9) if you have suggestions for future technical workshops!)
