**Address: 1021 Anacapa Street Santa Barbara, CA 93101**

Located in downtown Santa Barbara, NCEAS is situated just off of State Street near the iconic Santa Barbara Courthouse. Entering the building is a little tricky as the entrance to the MEDS space is off of the parking lot, not Anacapa - see photo below.

## Parking

There is a city lot (Lot 8) attached to the building. It is free for the first 75 minutes and $2.50 per hour after that. There is free street parking a few blocks away, just make sure to look for street sweeping restrictions.

There is limited bike parking available nearby on the sidewalk.

## Bus

If you live in on-campus housing, or in Isla Vista, the Santa Barbara [MTD 24X line](https://sbmtd.gov/routes/route-24x/) is the most efficient bus route between NCEAS and the University. Hop on at the closest stop to your home, and get off at the transit center on Carillo and Chapala, which is just 2 blocks from NCEAS. **Be sure to check the schedule so you arrive before Orientation and classes begin.**
