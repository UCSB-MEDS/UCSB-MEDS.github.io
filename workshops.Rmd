`r fontawesome::fa("desktop", fill = "#003660", a11y = "sem")` **Creating your personal website using Quarto** | August 5, 2022 | ~1 hour

<span style = 'font-size:95%;'>[`r fontawesome::fa("file-alt", fill = "#64605F", a11y = "sem")` instructional documentation](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/)  |  [`r fontawesome::fa("github-square", fill = "#64605F", a11y = "sem")` source code](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/creating-quarto-websites)</span> 

<span style = 'font-size:95%; color:#959599;'>*A personal website is not only a great way to showcase your experiences and skills, but also gives people (potential employers included!) a better sense of who you are as a person. There are lots of great ways to build websites using R (e.g. `{distill}`, `{blogdown}`) -- this year, we'll be using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), an exciting, new, and versatile publishing tool that supports R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS.*</span>
