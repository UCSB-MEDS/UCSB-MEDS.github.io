title: "Computer requirements & recommendations"
---

The MEDS program requires all students to have a personal laptop to use during the program. Our curriculum is designed to work across different operating systems and computers, as long as they meet some minimum requirements.  

### Specifically, your computer should:  
- be no more than 4 years old, and in any case be fully supported by the manufacturer. For example, [Apple won't repair anything that's more than 7 years old](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624)   
- be running Windows, macOS or Linux. (Please note that we offer limited support for Linux)  
- have at least 50 GB storage space available for MEDS applications and coursework  
- have at least 8 GB of RAM (the more the better!)  
- have a 64-bit CPU  

If you have a Mac, be sure to update macOS to the newest supported version, as indicated by *System Preferences&rarr;Software Update*.   

If you have a PC, you should have Windows 10 installed. If you don't, you can [purchase Windows 10 Education for $14.99 from UCSB](https://ucsb.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=14f7e678-4731-e511-940e-b8ca3a5db7a1). 

### New Computers 

If you are purchasing a new computer, we recommend:

- at least 16 GB of RAM 
- at least 512 GB of SSD (not "disk"!) storage 
- the manucafturer's extended warranty or service plan (e.g., [AppleCare+](https://www.apple.com/support/products/mac/)). 

If you are trying to decide between Mac and Windows we would recommend a Mac, but if you purchase or already have a Windows PC, donâ€™t worry that will be just fine as long as it meets our minimum requirements.
  
You can [purchase a Macbook Air using the higher education discount](https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop) for \$899 before tax and AppleCare. A PC can cost anywhere from \$500 to more than $3,000; you generally get what you pay for.

### Loaner equipment   
If your computer breaks or dies, we can usually loan you a Windows laptop for up to a month, which should be long enough to have your computer repaired or buy a new one.

### Home setup
At home you may want to have a dedicated computer setup that includes an external monitor (or 2!), keyboard, and mouse.
