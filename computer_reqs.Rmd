title: "Computer requirements & recommendations"
---

The MEDS program requires all students to have a personal laptop to use during the program. Our curriculum is designed to work across different operating systems and computers, but there are some important requirements.   

### Your computer should:  
- not be more than 4 years old. It should also be supported by the manufacturer. For example, Apple [does not support](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201624) devices 7 years or older   
- be running Windows, Mac OS or Linux. Please note that we have limited support for Linux  
- have 50 GB disk space available   
- have at least 8 GB of RAM (the more the better!)  
- use a 64-bit CPU  

If you have a Mac, make sure your operating system is the most recently supported version. Currently this is [Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/) 11.2.3.   

If you have a PC, you should have Windows 10 installed. You can purchase Windows 10 Education for $14.99 from UCSB [here](https://ucsb.onthehub.com/WebStore/OfferingDetails.aspx?o=14f7e678-4731-e511-940e-b8ca3a5db7a1). 

If you are purchasing a new computer, our recommended setup would be a computer with 16GB Memory (RAM) and 512 GB SSD. Also make sure to buy a 3-year warranty (at least)! If you are trying to decide between Mac and Windows we would recommend a Mac, but if you purchase or have a Windows PC donâ€™t worry that will be just fine as long as it has the minimum requirements.
  
You can purchase a low end Macbook Air using the [higher education discount](https://www.apple.com/us-hed/shop) for \$899 before tax and Applecare. A PC can cost between \$500 - $3,000 but you generally get what you pay for.

### Home setup
At home you may want to have a dedicated computer setup that includes an external monitor (or 2!), keyboard, and mouse. 

### Loaner equipment 
It is inevitable that some of our students will have computers that break, die, or get spilled on throughout the year. We have a small stockpile of Windows PC laptops that we can loan to you for 1 month. This should be enough time for you to have your computer repaired or buy a new one.
