EDS 213,"Metadata Standards, Data Modeling and Data Semantics",2,"Metadata is the information that provides the context for environmental data, rendering it usable by programs and intelligible to humans. This course introduces students to the ontologies that define, and the tools needed to compose, standard environmental metadata. Examples drawn from evaluating fitness-for-use, synthesizing composite datasets, and reusing historical datasets will motivate the need for correct and complete metadata.",TBD
EDS 211,"Team Science, Collaborative Analysis and Project Management",2,"Science in general, and data science in particular, are more and more requiring team science approaches to addressing the most pressing questions. Managing team science projects is therefore becoming an increasingly important skill for any scientist. This course will explore the principles and practical tools available for effective and efficient project management.",TBD
EDS 220,Remote Sensing and Environmental Data,4,"This course introduces students to the broad range of data sets that are used to monitor and understand the human and natural systems relevant for environmental science and management. The course will cover field-based and station data, remote sensing products, and large-scale climate datasets including climate model projections.",Samantha Stevenson
EDS 222,Statistics for Environmental Data Science,4,"This course teaches a variety of statistical techniques commonly used to address and analyze environmental data sets and questions and will provide an introduction to foundational concepts of spatial and space-time dependency and associated impacts on inference, with simple models illustrating the impact of space-time dependence when analyzing data from environmental processes.",Tamma Carleton
EDS 223,Spatial Analysis for Environmental Data Science,4,"This course introduces the spatial modeling and analytic techniques of geographic information science to data science students. The emphasis is on deep understanding of spatial data models and the analytic operations they enable. In addition to this theoretical background, students will acquire facility with libraries, packages, and APIs that support spatial analysis in Python and R.",James Frew
