EDS 220,Working with Environmental Data,4,"Introduces students to the broad range of data sets used to monitor and understand human and natural systems. Course will cover field and station data, remote sensing products, and large-scale climate datasets including climate model projections. Skills will include evaluating data collection and quality control methods used in existing datasets, and working with existing databases of time-series and spatial information including cloud computing databases and new repositories of environmental datasets. Students will learn basic workflows for selecting, obtaining, and visualizing datasets, and best practices for reliable data intercomparisons. Students will gain hands-on experience with an environmental dataset of their choice by developing tutorial Jupyter notebook materials for a relevant use case.",Samantha Stevenson
EDS 222,Statistics for Environmental Data Science,4,"This course teaches a variety of statistical techniques commonly used to analyze environmental data sets and quantitatively address environmental questions with empirical data. The course covers fundamental statistical concepts and tools, including sampling and study design, linear regression, inference, and time series analysis, as well as foundational concepts of spatial and space-time dependency and associated impacts on inference.",Tamma Carleton
EDS 223,Geopatial Analysis & Remote Sensing,4,"This course introduces the spatial modeling and analytic techniques of geographic information science to data science students. The emphasis is on deep understanding of spatial data models and the analytic operations they enable. Recognizing remotely sensed data as a key data type within environmental data science, this course will also introduce fundamental concepts and applications of remote sensing. In addition to this theoretical background, students will become familiar with libraries, packages, and APIs that support spatial analysis in R.",Ruth Oliver
EDS 242,Ethics & Bias in Environmental Data Science,2,"This course will focus on ethical considerations in collecting, using, and reporting environmental data, and how to recognize and account for biases in algorithms, training data, and methodologies. Students will also examine the human and societal implications of these issues within environmental data science.",Dena Montague
