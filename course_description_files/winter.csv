EDS 232,Machine Learning in Environmental Science,4,"This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern recognition. Topics include supervised learning (decision tree, random forest, support vector machines, neural networks) and unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, deep learning).",Ben Best
EDS 240,Data Visualization and Communication,4,"This course will include a discussion of the theory of good visual design and interactive analysis and also present software tools and techniques supporting visual analysis. Students will learn how to ask an interesting data question through MySQL, learn processing software to visualize it in 2D, do a 3D interactive visualization, then follow with a project of a data of their choice. Additional topics will include dynamic and interactive visualization and web-based visualization frameworks.",Stacy Rebich-Hespanha
EDS 241,Environmental Policy Evaluation,4,"This course will present state of the art program evaluation techniques necessary to evaluate the impact of environmental policies. The program evaluation methods presented will aim at identifying and measuring the causal effect of policies, regulations, and interventions on environmental outcomes of interest. Students will learn the research designs and methods for estimating causal effects with experimental and non-experimental data. This will prepare the students for interpreting and conducting high-quality empirical research, with applications in cross-sectional data and panel data settings.",Olivier Deschenes
EDS 411A,MEDS Capstone Course,4,"First quarter of a two-quarter group study/analysis of how to apply data science and tools to an environmental problem. In this quarter, students are expected to work with their project client to finalize project plans, assign individual roles and responsibilities, develop a project design plan and deliverables, and make significant headway on implementing those plans.",Allison Horst
