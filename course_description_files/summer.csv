EDS 212,Essential Math for Environmental Data Science,2,"Review of quantitative methods that are commonly used in environmental science. The course will cover single and multivariable functions and graphing, basic linear algebra, complex numbers, integral calculus and simple differential equations.",Allison Horst
EDS 221,Scientific Programming Essentials,4,"This course teaches key scientific programming skills and demonstrates the application of these techniques to environmental data analysis and problem solving. Topics include structured programming and algorithm development, flow control, simple and advanced data input-output and representation, functions and objects, documentation, testing and debugging. The course will be taught using a combination of the R and Python programming languages.",Allison Horst
EDS 214,Analytical Workflows and Scientific Reproducibility,2,"The generation and analysis of environmental data is often a complex, multi-step process that may involve the collaboration of many people. Increasingly tools that document and help to organize workflows are being used to ensure reproducibility, shareability, and transparency of the results. This course will introduce students to the conceptual organization of workflows (including code, documents, and data) as a way to conduct reproducible analyses. These concepts will be combined with the practice of various software tools and collaborative coding techniques to develop and manage multi-step analytical workflows as a team.",Julien Brun
EDS 215,Introduction to Data Storage and Management,2,"This course explores using filesystems and relational databases to store and manage environmental information. Students will learn to use the `bash` command language to manipulate files, and the `SQL` language to create and query databases. The course will highlight the importance of filesystem organization and database structure to the survivability and usability of scientific information.",James Frew
EDS 216,Meta-analysis and Systematic Reviews,2,"Synthesis tools in environmental science are rapidly evolving and becoming standard, formalized tools for review and assessment. Synthesis can include data aggregation, narrative reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analysis. Meta-analyses in particular are often viewed as the gold-standard methodology to quantitatively estimate the state-of-the-art of a research domain. The analytics and assumptions have changed significantly within the last 5 years. Key topics covered in this course include effect sizes, scope of inference, and statistical analyses using weighted measures.",Scott Jasechko
