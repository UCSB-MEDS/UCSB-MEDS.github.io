EDS 230,Modeling Environmental Systems,4,"Computer-based modeling and simulation for practical environmental problem solving and environmental research. The course will cover both the selection and application of existing models and best practices for designing new models. Topics include conceptual models, static and dynamic models, spatial models, and models of diffusion, growth and disturbance. Techniques include sensitivity analysis, calibration and model scenario design.",Naomi Tague
EDS 231,Text and Sentiment Anaysis for Environmental Problems,2,"This course will cover foundations and applications of natural language processing. Problem sets and class projects will leverage common and emerging text-based data sources relevant to environmental problems, including but not limited to social media feeds (e.g., Twitter) and text documents (e.g., agency reports), and will build capacity and experience in common tools, including text processing and classification, semantics, and natural language parsing.",TBD
EDS 242, Ethics & Bias in Environmental Data Science,2,"This course will focus on ethical considerations in collecting, using, and reporting environmental data, and how to recognize and account for biases in algorithms, training data, and methodologies. Students will also examine the human and societal implications of these issues within environmental data science.",TBD
EDS 411B,MEDS Capstone Course,4,"Second quarter of a two-quarter group study/analysis of how to apply data science and tools to an environmental problem. In this quarter, students are expected to complete all project plans and deliverables, develop and submit a project repository and technical documentation, give an oral defense of the project, present the research to a general audience.",Allison Horst
