The Master's of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) is a professional degree program at UC Santa Barbara, administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). The 11-month program is designed to train environmental professionals in data science skills. Coursework includes scientific programming, machine learning, remote sensing, spatial analysis, data visualization and much more. The program ends with a 6-month group Capstone project. These projects are proposed by clients with a need for data science solutions to solve their environmental problems or answer environmentally-related questions. Students work in groups of 3-4 during the Winter and Spring quarter and present final results at the end of the year. 

### In the MEDS program, students build skills to:

- Work in multiple programming languages (e.g. R, Python, SQL)
- Collaborate and manage data science projects, including with version control using git and GitHub
- Use open science methods and tools for reproducible data science
- Access, clean, explore, and analyze a range of common environmental data formats
- Understand and employ modern standards for data management, storage, and archiving
- Work with a team to complete a capstone project
- Think critically about and incorporate ethics, bias, and data justice into data science projects
- Communicate effectively with diverse stakeholders
