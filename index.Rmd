The Master's of Environmental Data Science (MEDS) is a professional degree program administered by the [Bren School of Environmental Science & Management](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) in partnership with the [National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/). The 11-month program is designed to train environmental professionals in data science skills. Coursework includes scientific programming, machine learning, remote sensing, spatial analysis, data visualization and much more. The program ends with a 6-month group Capstone project. These projects are proposed by clients with a need for data science solutions to solve their environmental problems or answer environmentally-related questions. Students work in groups of 3-4 during the Winter and Spring quarter and present final results at the end of the year. 

In the program students will:

- learn multiple programming languages (R, Python, SQL)
- be trained to work collaboratively with version control and GitHub
- be taught open science methods with a focus on reproducibility
- gain exposure to a variety of common environmental data formats
- learn current standards for data management, storage and archiving
- work as part of a data science team
